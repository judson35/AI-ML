    "In this problem you will use `sklearn.svm.SVR` to train a support vector machine for a regression problem. Your model will predict G forces experienced by a sports car as it travels through a chicane in the Nurburgring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill out the notebook as instructed, making the requested plots and printing necessary values. \n",
    "\n",
    "*You are welcome to use any of the code provided in the lecture activities.*\n",

    "#### Summary of deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Results:\n",
    "- Plot the fitted SVR function for three different epsilon values\n",
    "- Compute the R2 score for each of the fitted functions\n",
