    "## Problem Description\n",
    "In this problem you will use PCA and TSNE to apply dimensionality reduction to 64x64 images of signed distance fields (SDFs) on parts belonging to 8 different classes. Each class is topologicaly similar, with some variation in void size and shape. These signed distance fields are helpful in the prediction of internal stress fields in the parts. You will also apply KNN to predict the class of the part with the reduced space.\n",
