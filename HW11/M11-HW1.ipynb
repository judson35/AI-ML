    "## Problem Description\n",
    "In this problem you will use DBSCAN to cluster two melt pool images from a powder bed fusion metal 3D printer. Often times during printing there can be spatter around the main melt pool, which is undesirable. If we can successfully train a model to identify images with large amounts of spatter, we can automatically monitor the printing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill out the notebook as instructed, making the requested plots and printing necessary values. \n",
    "\n",
    "*You are welcome to use any of the code provided in the lecture activities.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary of deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bitmap visualization of melt pool images 1 and 2\n",
    "- Visualization of final DBSCAN clustering result for both melt pool images\n",
    "- Discussion of tuning, final number of clusters, and the sensitivity of the model parameters for the two images.\n",
